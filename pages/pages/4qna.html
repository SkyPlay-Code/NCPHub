        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <span>In the "Little Boy" bomb, the element used is the uranium isotope U-235.</span>
        <span>I will answer the question from KronosGamer later, but first, I want to discuss why U-235 is mainly used, and the same reasoning applies to Pu-239.</span>

    <section>
        <h2>Why U-235 is mainly used</h2>
        <h3>1. Fissile Nature</h3>
        <span>U-235 is a naturally fissile isotope, meaning it occurs in nature on its own and is feasible for use because it can sustain a chain reaction. When it undergoes fission, it splits into smaller nuclei that can also undergo fission, continuing the process.</span>
        
        <h3>2. Natural Availability</h3>
        <span>Although U-235 is naturally occurring, it is not easy to find because about 99.3% of uranium is U-238, and only about 0.7% is U-235. However, it is still abundant enough to be used. I should also mention that 1 kg of uranium is equivalent to 27 lakh kg of coal in terms of energy output.</span>
        
        <h3>3. Critical Mass</h3>
        <span>The most important aspect is the supercritical and subcritical mass of uranium. U-235 has a relatively low critical mass, which is the minimum amount of material needed to maintain a self-sustaining chain reaction. This makes it compact and suitable for use in nuclear weapons.</span>
        
        <h3>4. Neutron Efficiency</h3>
        <span>U-235 releases more neutrons than it absorbs. When U-235 undergoes fission, it releases neutrons, which can either be absorbed by other U-235 atoms or be deflected until they are absorbed. U-235's potential to sustain fission and accelerate the process makes it highly efficient.</span>
        
        <h3>5. Energy Efficiency</h3>
        <span>U-235 is more efficient at releasing energy per fission event compared to other materials.</span>

        <h2>Why Thorium cannot be used</h2>
        <span>Thorium cannot be used because it is not fissile.</span>
        <span>To determine whether an element or isotope is fissile involves a combination of nuclear physics and empirical data (information gathered through observation, experiment, etc.).</span>
        
        <h3>Criteria for fissile isotopes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fissile isotopes tend to have an odd number of neutrons. When a neutron is absorbed, the nucleus ends up with an even number of nucleons, which tends to be more stable or at least in a state more likely to undergo fission.</li>
          <li>Binding energy per nucleon.</li>
          <li>Models treating the nucleus like a drop of fluid, which helps to predict the likelihood of fission.</li>
          <li>The shell model, which considers the arrangement of protons and neutrons (you will study this in class 11).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <span>There are many other requirements as well.</span>
        
        <h3>Theoretical use of Thorium</h3>
        <span>Theoretically, thorium can be used in nuclear weapons because when Th-232 absorbs a neutron, it eventually decays into U-233, which is somewhat similar to U-235, though not as efficient. However, the process is very complex and requires a nuclear reactor. Additionally, U-233 is not very practical because it contains some amount of U-232, which is highly radioactive and difficult to handle.</span>
